	abstract = {The use of color in {QR} codes brings extra data capacity, but also inﬂicts tremendous challenges on the decoding process due to chromatic distortion—cross-channel color interference and illumination variation. Particularly, we further discover a new type of chromatic distortion in high-density color {QR} codes—cross-module color interference—caused by the high density which also makes the geometric distortion correction more challenging. To address these problems, we propose two approaches, {LSVM}-{CMI} and {QDA}-{CMI}, which jointly model these different types of chromatic distortion. Extended from {SVM} and {QDA}, respectively, both {LSVM}-{CMI} and {QDA}-{CMI} optimize over a particular objective function and learn a color classiﬁer. Furthermore, a robust geometric transformation method and several pipeline reﬁnements are proposed to boost the decoding performance for mobile applications. We put forth and implement a framework for high-capacity color {QR} codes equipped with our methods, called {HiQ}. To evaluate the performance of {HiQ}, we collect a challenging large-scale color {QR} code dataset, {CUHK}-{CQRC}, which consists of 5390 high-density color {QR} code samples. The comparison with the baseline method [2] on {CUHK}-{CQRC} shows that {HiQ} at least outperforms [2] by 188\% in decoding success rate and 60\% in bit error rate. Our implementation of {HiQ} in {iOS} and Android also demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework in real-world applications.},
